# GCPexercises
In this repo i will put my exercises for the "Sistemi e Applicazioni Cloud" exam @UNIMORE. The prerequisites are having an Google Cloud Platform account(don't use your accademic mail, it may block you from certain features) and having the GCP SDK installed.

## CLI commands
```bash
gcloud components update
```
