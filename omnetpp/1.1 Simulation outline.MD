# Setup commands 
This readme assumes you have a functioning setup for Omnetpp and we're working in the `samples/queuenet` directory.
```bash
. setenv
cd samples/queuenet
```
## Job outline
- we define our .ned file, mako and json files
- run the commands to generate the simulation results
- check the .data file we generated to see the results

## Generate the .ini file and the runfile
After creating our `.ned`  and `mako` files we run these commands.
```bash
update_template.py
make_runfile.py -f MM1.ini
make -j $(nproc) -f Runfile
```

## Generate the `.db` file
After setting up the `***.json` file we generate our sqlite db.
```bash
parse_data.py -c configMM1.json -d MM1.db -r results/MM1_rho*.sca
analyze_data.py -d MM1.db -c configMM1.json
```
> [!NOTE]
> The ini, mako, sca and json files have names that refer to the MM1 example, you're free to change the names as you like.


## Run omnetpp simulator
If we want to we can simulate the setup in Omnetpp by calling a referencing to a specific configuration in our .ini generate file.
```bash
./queuenet -f MM1.ini -c MM1_rho080_K100 -r0
```
